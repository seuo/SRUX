                                    main focus was on the marine industry. The new logo and website required a more
                                    premium design along with a more logical catagory / navigation hirechy.

                                    <p>Brand Design / Site Design / Drafting & Rendering</p>
                                    10 Squares Cabins is a new manufacturer of small cabins & sleep-outs that fit
                                    within the 10mÂ² council requirements. They required a brand-id along with a
                                    website showcasing the quality and process that goes into building their kitset
                                    cabins. I worked closely with the 10 Squares team to create a clean &
                                    informative website. Using renders I was able to show the customer the build
                                    process from start to finish. I continued work for them doing drafting & render
                                    work for customers who needed custom builds.

                                    <p>Site Design</p>
                                    Gubba required a site design for their garden shed range. They wanted their
                                    website to easily display their full range & the amount of customisations
                                    possible. To do this I would develop a functional shed configurator which I
                                    integrated with an online ecommerce platform. This made it possible for
                                    customers to resize, change colour, add doors, windows & add a variety of other
                                    extras, it also gave them ability to add assembly service to their order. The
                                    shed configurator has been a great point of difference between Gubba Garden
                                    Sheds & their competitors.

                                    <p>I designed the navigation to be as simple as possible making it childâs play
                                        to use and navigate. Making the buttons directly link through to the product
                                        category pages without any dropdowns made it really easy to use.

                                    <p>The team at heliboard nz needed a redesign of their website to look more
                                        modern & eye catching.</p>
                                    <p>They wanted the website to be designed for results, they were getting the
                                        traffic but not the conversion rate. I came up with a solution by designing more
                                        of a one page site with the most important features at the top that customers
                                        would be interested in. By creating an eye catching call to action & displaying
                                        the instructors directly below, heliboard.nz has had a large improvement in
                                        conversions from the booking system.

                                    <p>The Mangawhai Village Market needed a brand for their ever growing markets I
                                        discussed with them design concepts & we came up with the idea to include a
                                        local bird, the Fairy Tern, which is a distinctive bird that locals will
                                        recognize.</p>
                                    <p>I really enjoyed working on this brand, something a bit different.</p>

                                    <p>The Cabin Crew team required a logo for their newly formed building company.
                                        The owner wanted a brand that meant something to him, but also had a
                                        contemporary and professional design to reflect the modern dwellings they were
                                        building.</p>
                                    <p>I used red & black colours to show his Maori heritage and a wave design to
                                        reflect one of his passions in life, surfing. I enjoyed working with him to come
                                        up with a design we were both happy with.

                                    <p>I wanted to design something that really caught the eye, was simple & not too
                                        obvious. I feel I achieved this by only using two colours & having the finer
                                        details large enough to read but small enough to take a second look.</p>

                                    <p>They wanted their brand to appeal to the average New Zealander and the design
                                        to reflect a medium price point. The subtle green koru patterns at the base of
                                        the pack work with the rest of the design to portray a New Zealand feel.</p>

                                        styling, coding, cms development as well as agile group work. I also got a great

                                    <p>Gubba Products Ltd / 2006 - 2018</p>
                                    <p>My main role at Gubba Products Ltd involved designing content for print and
                                        digital. I created advertising material for Gubba Products in magazines such as
                                        New Zealand Gardener, Weekend Gardener, and Your Home & Garden. I was also
                                        responsible for designing their yearly catalogue for their large home and garden
                                        product range.</p>
                                    <p>I was later assigned the job of designing and building several web sites for
                                        specific products that needed dedicated ecommerce stores which helped drive
                                        revenue. Most notably their Gubba Garden Sheds Website which has improved on
                                        sales every year since and continues to improve.</p>
                                    <p>When I wasn't working on design, I was learning new skills in other areas.
                                        With the position being an In-house role I also took on a variety of extra work,
                                        whether it was for the sales team, taking calls for customer service or being
                                        their IT guy. There was a lot of variety at Gubba, I enjoyed helping out where
                                        ever I could and enjoyed working with the Gubba team.</p>
